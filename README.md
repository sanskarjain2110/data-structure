# Data-Structures And Algorithms

### Data-structure

Orgamizarion of data in a systematic manner in Computer so that it can be use efficently

Mainly they are of type:

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Graph
* Hash Table

### Algorithms

A set of rules that must be followed when solving a particular problem.

#### this file contains data structure and algorithms using various languages right now this repository holds the following languages :&#x20;

* :snake: Python[Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
* &#x20;Cpp[Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

## C++

```
    1. Arrays
    2. Linked list
    3. Stack


    in Arrays :
        1. Insertion at the beginning of an array
        2. Insertion at the end of an array
        3. Insertion at any position of an array


    in Linked list :
        1. Derived code of Linear linked list
        2. Derived code of Double linked list or both way linked list
```
