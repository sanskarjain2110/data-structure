### Data-structure

Orgamizarion of data in a systematic manner in Computer so that it can be use efficently

Mainly they are of type:

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Tree
* Graph
* Hash Table

### Algorithms

A set of rules that must be followed when solving a particular problem.

#### this file contains data structure and algorithms using various languages right now this repository holds the following languages :&#x20;

* [Java](https://app.gitbook.com/s/2XlFHV0K8O9A0e8Y6ESw/\~/changes/kMABVUbp69tQacrBfqmy/java/java)
* [Python](python/python.md)
* &#x20;[Cpp](cpp/cpp.md)



```
    1. Arrays
    2. Linked list
    3. Stack


    in Arrays :
        1. Insertion at the beginning of an array
        2. Insertion at the end of an array
        3. Insertion at any position of an array


    in Linked list :
        1. Derived code of Linear linked list
        2. Derived code of Double linked list or both way linked list
```
